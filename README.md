## About the Assessment

My task is to write code that can sort this list based on different criteria, such as price or the ratio of sales to views (sales count divided by views count), depending on the context. And i used Laravel to provide this solution.

Here are the step to view the assessment:
- I've already exported the test files i used, so create a MySQL database and upload it.
- Open the project folder in your terminall and run **composer install**, once done; **run php artisan serve**
- Once you run the **run php artisan serve**, open the url displayed there on your browser.
